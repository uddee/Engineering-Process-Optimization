# Engineering Process Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on automating solutions to improve data handling and analytics for engineering projects. The goal is to enhance the performance of system components, reduce latency, and optimize processes throughout the engineering workflow.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Handling**: Processes raw data by cleaning, normalizing, and aggregating it to prepare for analysis.
- **System Performance Optimization**: Simulates system performance to identify latency issues and optimize execution times.
- **Scalable System Components**: Designed for scalability to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Collaboration with Stakeholders**: Tools to support collaboration with stakeholders for identifying areas for optimization.

## How It Works
The project consists of Python functions that:
1. **Optimize Data Handling**:
   - Cleans data (removes missing or negative values).
   - Normalizes data to standardize the metrics.
   - Aggregates data by category to facilitate performance tracking.
2. **Simulate System Performance**:
   - Measures execution time to simulate system tasks.
   - Provides insights into potential optimization needs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
